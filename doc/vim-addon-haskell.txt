As this plugin depends on other plugins it should be installed using
vim-addon-manager -> http://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager

Features:
=========================
- .cabal file folding
- .cabal file completion
- create easy mappings to run cabal or ghc 
  (See documentation of vim-addon-actions)

  Note: you can add special comments like this to tell the Plugin to add ghc
  options automatically. This is both: for your convinience and for documentation :-)

  -- ghc-options: -O2 -package FooBar

- run ghc or or cabal build usisng vim-addon-actions (Refer to the
  documentation of that plugin, please)

  Eg try one of
    :ActionOnBufWrite  (will run the action when you write a buffer)
  or type
    <s-f2> (will run the action when you press F2. This may work in gvim only)
  type ghc or cabal

  You can use the "run ghc compilation result" action to run what you compiled by ghc

Also have a look at mappings in ftplugin/lhaskell.vim

TODO
=========================
- use Vim help format for this file
- (re)compile Setup automatically (I use hack-nix..)
- Cabal Syntax file?
- ...
- setup mapping automatically if a .cabal file is present?
  (my tovl library does this)
